# BTW-calculator
Fun little c++ project i started for my dad

This is just some beginner project that i like to work on and improve since it helps me stay motivated to learn c++ and see what it has to offer. Code might be terrible but we all gotta start somewhere!

It's called BTW-Calculator because it stands for **"Belasting over toegevoegde waarde"** which means **"value added tax"**
This is a dutch naming for "Tax" so hence why i called it "BTW" :) Might change in the future but who knows

[TODO]
- Want to make a GUI for it.
- Maybe implement choosing from different tax brackets (EU/US/ASIA) etc etc.
- Make it more interactive, pretty plain right now
