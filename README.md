# BTW-calculator
Fun little c++ project i started for my dad

It's called BTW-Calculator because it stands for "Belasting over toegevoegde waarde" which means "value added tax"
This is a dutch naming for "Tax" so hence why i called it "BTW" :) Might change in the future but who knows

[TODO]

- Want to make a GUI for it.
- Maybe implement choosing from different tax brackets (EU/US/ASIA) etc etc.
- Make it more interactive, pretty plain right now
